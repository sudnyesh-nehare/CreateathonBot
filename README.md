## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher installed.
- A MongoDB Atlas database for storing user data.
- A Telegram bot token from [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather).

### Token Information
Once you've created your bot via [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather), you'll receive a bot token to interact with the Telegram Bot API. Keep it secure!

Your bot's token:  
`8046487268:AAGEQxG7iWmoQ2QgZFIQMue_3Ahy63Hfd9A`  
Store this token safely as it grants control over your bot. Do **not** share it with others unless you're certain they should have access.
